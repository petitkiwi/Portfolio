This 54-card deck marries classic patterns with a blank canvas in the center, inviting the players to customize each card with provided markers. This unique feature allows you to play traditional games like Poker or get inventive with your own creations."

(2) Inflatable structure: Use of durable and resistant materials for the inflatable structure, ensuring the robot's safety and longevity, as well as the integration of movement and air inflation/emptying mechanisms to enable robot interaction and movement. (3) Technology: Integration of on-board electronics (sensors, valve motors and programming) to automate interactions.

However, commonly used soft materials, such as silicone and thermoplastics, are not sustainable. In contrast, biopolymers are naturally derived, biodegradable and versatile materials, making them a suitable alternative for fabricating SCIs. I co-wrote a research paper for a conference or scientific journal that presents how a readily available biopolymer(i.e. Sodium Alginate) can be leveraged to realize diverse shape-changing behaviors. The paper discusses how the material can be synthesized in a DIY setup to yield properties desirable for shape-change. It further brings a set of fabrication and assembling techniques for creating soft interfaces that realize fundamental forms of shape-change. The application examples demonstrate how this material can replicate traditional soft materials in shape-changing interfaces. The paper discusses limitations, open research questions and common fabrication challenges as biopolymer-based interfaces continue to expand."
